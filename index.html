			<h1 style="background-color:white;text-align:center;font-size:35px;">Background Story</h1>
				<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;">I was born in Winter Springs, Florida on March 25th, 1995.  Growing up I had three siblings.  One sister and two step-brothers.  I've always been interested in computers and electronics of all sorts since I was young.  Mom says I could start the computer and load up my favorite game all by myself by the time I was a year old.  In my teens I discovered Raspberry-Pi's and Linux OS witch got me interested in automation and making simple mundain tasks either easier or obsolete through programming.  Starting a band also forced me to learn about and aquire a wide array of gear and specified knowledge so I could control every aspect of our sound and image.  Only recently have I truly begun to realize the power and potential of what computers can accomplish.<br>
