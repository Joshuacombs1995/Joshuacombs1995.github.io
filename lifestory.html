<h1 style="text-align:center;background-color:white;font-size:42px;">Life Story</h1>
<p style="font-size:18px;text-align:center;">I was born in Winter Springs, Florida on March 25th, 1995. Growing up I had one sister and two step-brothers. I've always been interested in computers and electronics of all sorts since I was young. Mom says I could start the computer and load up my favorite game all by myself by the time I was a year old. Music got me more into computers later on using frost-wire to fill up my mp3 player and later on in life when me and friends started a band I had to learn even more software and hardware. In my teens I discovered Raspberry-Pi's and Linux OS witch got me interested in automation and making simple mundain tasks either easier or obsolete through programming. Only recently have I truly begun to realize the power and potential of what computers can accomplish.
